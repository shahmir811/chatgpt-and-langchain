# TChat

Making a chatbot that will run from the terminal. Whenever the user runs our program, we're going to show two little arrows like `>> ` so. 
And the user is then going to type some text into their terminal directly, something like what is 1 + 1?

As soon as they then hit the enter key, we're going to consider that to be a text submission, take the text and send it to the chat model (ChatGPT)

And we're going to print out whatever response we get. So in this case probably something like it's 2. 
After we print out that response, we're then going to allow a user to add in additional questions. So then they can say something like and 3 more. 
As soon as they hit enter, then see response, and we should get something like five or whatever else.

And naturally, this is not going to be a chatbot about just doing very simple math equations.

This is just an example. User can type in anything they want here.
