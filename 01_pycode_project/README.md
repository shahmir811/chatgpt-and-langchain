# PyCode

Created a small application where we use langChain to link multiple chains and
get interactions with openAI

### Usage

At the root of the folder, replace file `.env-example` with name `.env` and add the openAI key:

```OPENAI_API_KEY=```


### Run the program

In order to run a program you have to type the `language` and `task` flags, 
else it will use the default flags

```python main.py --language python --task 'returns a list of numbers'```
